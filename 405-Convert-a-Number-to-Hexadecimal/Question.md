# 405. Convert a Number to Hexadecimal

[Original Page](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-a-number-to-hexadecimal/)

Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, [two’s complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) method is used.

**Note:**

1.  All letters in hexadecimal (`a-f`) must be in lowercase.
2.  The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading `0`s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character `'0'`; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
3.  The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
4.  You **must not use _any_ method provided by the library** which converts/formats the number to hex directly.

**Example 1:**

<pre>Input:
26

Output:
"1a"
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre>Input:
-1

Output:
"ffffffff"
</pre>
